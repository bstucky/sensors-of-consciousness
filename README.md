# We are the sensors of consciousness!
I reviewed and analyzed 69 awakening studies between 2000 and 2024 that collected experiential reports during sleep together with an analysis of the DREAM database (https://doi.org/10.26180/22133105) on participant characteristics. This repository contains the two main R code files used to generate the analyses, figures and tables of the following preprint: The code does not run on its own as the required data-sets need to be adapted from the DREAM database and the publication.<br />

If you reuse substantial parts of the code please cite the publication.<br />

## Files
- Rscripts/review.R is the code used to generate the analyses, figures and tables for the reviewed studies.<br />
- Rscripts/dream_db.R is the code used to generate the analyses, figures and tables for the DREAM database.
