This code follows my preprint: <br />
If you reuse substantial parts of the code please cite the publication.<br />

The repository contains the two main R code files. The code does not run on its own as the required data-sets need to be adapted from the DREAM database (https://doi.org/10.26180/22133105) and the publication.<br />

- Rscripts/review.R is the code used to generate the analyses, figures and tables of the 69 reviewed and analyzed awakening studies collecting experiences during sleep.<br />
- Rscripts/dream_db.R is the code used to generate the analyses, figures and tables for the DREAM database.
