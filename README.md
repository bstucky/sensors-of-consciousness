# We are the sensors of consciousness!
We reviewed and analyzed 69 awakening studies between 2000 and 2024 that collected experiential reports during sleep together with an analysis of the DREAM database (https://doi.org/10.26180/22133105, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/69e43) on participant characteristics. This repository contains the two main R code files used to generate the analyses, figures and tables of the following preprint:<br />https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.13.623388v1<br />

The code does not run on its own as it requires datasets from the DREAM database and the publication.<br />

If you reuse substantial parts of the code please cite the publication.<br />

## Files
- Rscripts/review.R is the code used to generate the analyses, figures and tables for the reviewed studies.<br />
- Rscripts/dream_db.R is the code used to generate the analyses, figures and tables for the DREAM database.
